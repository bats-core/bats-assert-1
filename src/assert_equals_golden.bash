# assert_equals_golden
# ============
#
# Summary: Fail if the actual and golden file contents are not equal.
#
# Usage: assert_equals_golden [-e | --regexp | -d | --diff] [--stdin] [--allow-empty] [--] [- | <actual>] <golden file path>
#
# Options:
#   -e, --regexp        Treat file contents of <golden file path> as an multiline extended regular expression.
#   -d, --diff          Displays `diff` between <actual> and golden contents instead of full strings.
#   -, --stdin          Read <actual> value from STDIN. Do not pass <actual> if set.
#   <actual>            The value being compared. May be `-` to use STDIN. Omit if `--stdin` is passed.
#   <golden file path>  A file that has contents which must match against <actual>.
#
#   ```bash
#   @test 'assert_equals_golden()' {
#     assert_equals_golden 'have' 'some/path/golden_file.txt'
#   }
#   ```
#
# IO:
#   STDIN  - actual value, if `--stdin` or `-` is supplied.
#   STDERR - expected and actual values, or their diff, on failure
# Globals:
#   BATS_ASSERT_UPDATE_GOLDENS_ON_FAILURE - The golden file's contents will be updated to <actual> if it did not match. 
# Returns:
#   0 - if <actual> is equal to file contents in <golden file path>
#   1 - otherwise
#
# Golden files hold the entirety of the expected output.
# Contents will properly/consistently match to empty lines / trailing new lines (when used with `run --keep-empty-lines` or similar).
# Golden files are, by default, not allowed to be empty. This is to catch common authoring errors. If intented, this can be overridden with `--allow-empty`.
#
# Golden files have a number of benefits when used for asserting against output, including:
#   * WYSIWYG plaintext output assertions (separating asserted output from test case logic).
#   * Test failure output that is searchable (asserted output is checked into repo as files).
#   * Clear file diffs of test assertions during merge / code review.
#   * Terse assertions in test cases (single assert instead of many verbose `assert_line` and `refute_line` for every line of output).
#   * Reusable golden files (declared once, used for many test cases).
#   * Clear intention (same exact expected output) when asserted against same goldens in multiple test cases.
#   * Can be clearly diff'd across multiple lines in failure message(s).
#   * Easily updated.
#
# The assertion string target, <actual>, can instead be supplied via STDIN.
# If `--stdin` is supplied, or if `-` is given as <actual>, STDIN will be read for the checked string.
# When suppliying `--stdin`, only 1 argument (<golden file path>) should be supplied.
#
# If the `BATS_ASSERT_UPDATE_GOLDENS_ON_FAILURE` environment variable is set, failed assertions will result in the golden file being updated.
# The golden file contents is updated to be able to pass upon subsequent runs.
# All tests that update goldens still fails (enforcing that all passing tests are achieved with pre-existing correct golden).
# This is set via an environment variable to allow mass golden file updates across many tests.
#
# ## Literal matching
#
# On failure, the expected and actual values are displayed. Line count is always displayed.
#
#   ```
#   -- value does not match golden --
#   golden contents (1 lines):
#   want
#   actual output (1 lines):
#   have
#   --
#   ```
#
# If `--diff` is given, the output is changed to `diff` between <actual> and the golden file contents.
#
#   ```
#   -- value does not match golden --
#   1c1
#   < have
#   ---
#   > want
#   --
#   ```
#
# ## Regular expression matching
#
# If `--regexp` is given, the golden file contents is treated as a multiline extended regular expression.
# This allows for volatile output (e.g. timestamps, identifiers) and/or secrets to be removed from golden files, but still constrained for proper asserting.
# Regular expression special characters (`][\.()*+?{}|^$`), when used as literals, must be escaped in the golden file.
# The regular expression golden file contents respects `\n` characters and expressions which span multiple lines.
#
# If the `BATS_ASSERT_UPDATE_GOLDENS_ON_FAILURE` environment variable is set with `--regexp`, special logic is used to reuse lines where possible.
# Each line in the existing golden will attempt to match to the line of <actual>, preferring longer lines.
# If no pre-existing golden line matches, that line will be updated with the exact line string from <actual>.
# Not all lines can be reused (e.g. multiline expressions), but the golden file can be manually changed after automatic update.
#
# `--diff` is not supported with `--regexp`.
